# SciTE-5.5.8-mod
A modified version with a dark theme, configured for Autohotkey v2.


Added:
    Lexer Autohotkey v2.
    Changed default settings in Embedded.properties (compare it with original).
    Dark theme by default. Configured only for AHK.
    Moved the wOutput window to the left. This allows you to look at the center of a wide screen when editing, rather than squinting to the left.
    FindFunctions function for AHK. Displays a list of functions in the wOutput window. Allows navigate to func by double click. (Open any AHK and you'll see it.)
    Reorganized the menu in a more logical order.
    An additional bookmark for the user.
    Clicking on a bookmark marker allows you to toggle it.
    Minimap for an overview of markers and history (wMarkerMap) and for quick navigation.
    Split-screen editor (wEditor2).
    Ability to rename a file (may contain errors, needs improvement).
    Ability to close all tabs except the current one.
    File encoding conversion (may contain bugs, needs improvement).
    The F3 search has been modified for quick searching without the dialog box (select text, press F3).
    Ctrl+Q: Comment/uncomment all lines based on the first one, instead of inverting all lines.
    Quickly switch the displayed encoding in the context menu.
